# Data Structures üêç

Remember `list`,`set`,`dictionary` are mutable and `tuple` is immutable
`list`,`tuple` elements can be reached by index  
for `dictionary` it is not an option to reach by index the element key has to be known to reach  
and for `set` the items cannot be reached directly but it is possible to iterate.

1. print the lengths of `list1`,`tuple1`,`set1`,`dict1`
2. print the first element of `list1` and `tuple1`
3. print the value of `lion` key of `dict1`
4. change the 2nd position element of `list1` to "rabbit"
5. try to change the 2nd position element of the tuple to "rabbit" and explain what happened.
6. add "monkey" to `list1`
7. remove "rabbit" from `list1`
8. in `dict1` the number of feet is written as value to each animal the fixh has wrong value just fix it.
