# Methods - Exercise 3 üêç

to convert a number to string we can use `str()` function this is called `casting`

1. cast num1 to string and assign to num1_str
2. check the length of the string
3. get the third element of string (the one in the 3rd order)
4. get the 3-5 elements of string (both inclusive) by string slicing
5. check if num2 in string (cast if necessary)
6. check if num3 in string (cast if necessary)
7. concatenate 0 to the string from left and assign to string_with_0
8. get the characters of string_with_0 from start to position 4 (end point exclusive)
9. get the characters of string_with_0 from position 5 until the end
10. use negative indexing to reach the "567" string_with_0
